#+TITLE: LET LISP
#+AUTHOR: E.M. From <vertlaforet@protonmail.com>

Welcome fellow lambda enthousiast

Is it fast? Is it the best? LETs find out.

* Why LET LESP
L.E.T. = List Eating Trampoline

Since the name closure is already taken and lambda lisp seems a bit greedy.
Also, it _reduces_ LISP (no AST) so there will be no oxidation
Also, the stack is dead. Long live the stack.

* 

A LISP (that will at some point in the future be) featuring:
- lazy evaluation
- multithreaded core
- thunk trampoline execution style
- resource id based evaluation (no stack)
- continuation passing
- pure, minus local environment (for brevity) (maybe only as let sugar)
- State and io via delimited continuations (probably promise style)
- Parser and repl under lisp control
- Actual ABI/modules (cause haskell and rust piss me off royally)
- Incidental _and_ explicit memoisation
- Scheme R7-small:ish (unless it violates previously stated goals)

* Stuff todo
** TODO Trampoline
Ring of thunks to perform
Adds executor threads as needed ("add thread" markers in ring)

** TODO Memory
Ref counting
Caching allocs 

** TODO BIIG Hashtable for references
All results stored in one table
Dependencies tracked for each thunk

** TODO continuation passing eval

** TODO Parser and repl
Parser is integral, (parse <something) is the start of execution

#+begin_src letlisp
(define (parse)
   (display "Penguins!"))
#+end_src

Repl is integral (repl) reads using readline and calls parse

** TODO Compiler
Compile via reference, big hashes needed
Link to ELF libraries
